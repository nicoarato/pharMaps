App in ionic to find pharmacies with geolocation.


I am trying to create an ionic application where I can use my geolocation to find the nearest pharmacy.


To do this I spent time collecting the location of all the pharmacies in my city (Santa Fe - Argentina) and created a service.


To work with maps, on this occasion I chose <a src="https://www.mapbox.com" target="_blank"> Mapbox </a>.
